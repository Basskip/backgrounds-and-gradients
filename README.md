# Old Apple Website HTML/CSS copy

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements?ref=lnav) curriculum, replicating the basic HTML and CSS of an old version of Apple's website

## Things I learned
* How to use gradient backgrounds

## Things to work on
* The searchbar isn't quite right, lacks some of the shadows/depth of the original version

# Check it out yourself
